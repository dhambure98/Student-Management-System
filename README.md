# Student-Management-System

Mini project 1 : 🙂

Using java fundamentals, I created a form where students can get marks management system.

This is done in such a way that the application becomes golden by creating the home page. Most focused on using loops / methods & arrys.
There are some mistakes but they will be fixed in the future.

Happy coding ... 👨🏻‍💻🤭
